      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>In the summer of 2022, I was in a computer science research fellowship. I got to help test a new curriculum and complete group projects with my peers.</p>
      <p>I'm currently working at a Target in DeKalb. I met some really cool people and I enjoy learning about the store and helping guests.</p>
      <p>Before that, I was working as a zone leader at Amazon Fresh. I trained new employees and managed the delivery department.</p>

     <p class="secondary_p">I also worked for the physical operations team of the Spartan Marching band. I managed and maintenanced the instruments for over 300 band members.
      <br/><br/>
      Finally, when I was in high school I used to teach individual music lessons to middle school students. Between my sophomore and senior years of high school, I had 5 students and I would meet with them weekly.</p>
