       <h3>Hobbies</h3>
       <p>My favorite ways to pass the time are playing Valorant with my friends, music production, and video editing.</p>

       <p>I also really like sound design. In the Razer video, I took an advertisement for a gaming mouse and redid all of the sounds from scratch. I made the song and all of the sound effects and learned a lot!</p>

       <p>I also enjoy making lower quality videos where I get to explore and try new editing techniques. In the second video, I remixed a popular song and then recorded 5 different takes dancing and edited them all together.</p>

      I also recently got a new camera! I'm using it to practice filmmaking, but I also am learning a bit about photography as well!
