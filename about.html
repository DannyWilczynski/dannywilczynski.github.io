       <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p>In second grade, I moved to Naperville, IL and I've lived there for most of my life. Growing up, I was super curious and loved learning how things worked. Sometimes that meant I would spend hours watching minecraft tutorials, other times that meant I was taking apart my moms old laptop even though I had no idea how to put it back together.</p>
       <p>In high school, I became super involved in my school's music program and I joined all of the orchestras, bands, and jazz groups that I could. Music really taught me how to learn efficiently, and it's still a massive part of my life!</p>

    <p class="secondary_p">Now I live in DeKalb with my cat while I finish up my degree. I don't know where I will be in five years, but I'm excited to try new things and learn more about programming and myself.</p>
